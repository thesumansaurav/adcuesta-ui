                            <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Thinking you know what your audience is searching for without actually checking.</p>
                            <p><b>The Fix:</b> Use tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ubersuggest to find out what terms people are 
                                really using. These tools can show you the popularity of specific keywords and suggest related ones. 
                                It’s crucial to target the right keywords from the get-go.</p>

                            <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Loading your content with as many keywords as possible.</p>
                            <p><b>The Fix:</b> Focus on naturally incorporating keywords into your content. Aim for a balance where your 
                                writing still sounds human and engaging. Remember, search engines are smart enough to recognize and penalize 
                                keyword stuffing.</p>

                            <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Not optimizing your Meta descriptions and title tags or leaving them blank.</p>
                            <p><b>The Fix:</b> Write compelling, keyword-rich Meta descriptions and title tags for each page. These 
                                elements are often the first thing people see in search results, so make them count. They should be 
                                clear, concise, and enticing enough to get people to click through to your site.</p>

                            <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Focusing solely on keywords without providing valuable content.</p>
                            <p><b>The Fix:</b> Create high-quality content that answers questions, provides solutions, or entertains. 
                                Google rewards content that engages users and meets their needs. Invest time in creating blog posts, 
                                articles, and other content that offers real value.</p>

                            <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Having a website that isn’t mobile-friendly.</p>
                            <p><b>The Fix:</b> Ensure your website is responsive, meaning it looks and functions well on any device. 
                                With more people browsing on their phones, Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites in search rankings.</p>

                            <p><b>The Fix:</b> Use tools like Google Page Speed Insights to check your site’s speed. If it’s slow, 
                                consider optimizing images, enabling browser caching, and reducing server response times. A faster 
                                site not only ranks better but also keeps visitors happy.</p>

                            <p><b>The Fix:</b> Regularly review your analytics to see what’s working and what’s not. Look at metrics 
                                like bounce rate, average session duration, and page views to understand how visitors interact with your 
                                site. Use this data to make informed decisions about your SEO strategy.</p>

                            <p><b>The Fix:</b> Optimize your website for local searches by including local keywords, claiming your Google
