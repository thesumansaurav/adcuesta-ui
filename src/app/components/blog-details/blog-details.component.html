                            mistakes. Don’t worry, though—most of these errors are easy to fix once you know what they are. Let’s dive 
                            into the top SEO pitfalls and how you can avoid them to ensure your website shines in search results.</p>

                        <h3>1. Ignoring Keyword Research</h3>
                        <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Thinking you know what your audience is searching for without actually checking.</p>
                        <p><b>The Fix:</b> Use tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ubersuggest to find out what terms people are 
                            really using. These tools can show you the popularity of specific keywords and suggest related ones. 
                            It’s crucial to target the right keywords from the get-go.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="details-digital">
                        <h3>2. Keyword Stuffing</h3>
                        <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Loading your content with as many keywords as possible.</p>
                        <p><b>The Fix:</b> Focus on naturally incorporating keywords into your content. Aim for a balance where your 
                            writing still sounds human and engaging. Remember, search engines are smart enough to recognize and penalize 
                            keyword stuffing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="details-digital">
                        <h3>3. Neglecting Meta Descriptions and Title Tags</h3>
                        <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Not optimizing your Meta descriptions and title tags or leaving them blank.</p>
                        <p><b>The Fix:</b> Write compelling, keyword-rich Meta descriptions and title tags for each page. These 
                            elements are often the first thing people see in search results, so make them count. They should be 
                            clear, concise, and enticing enough to get people to click through to your site.</p>

                    <div class="details-digital">
                        <h3>4. Not Having Quality Content</h3>
                        <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Focusing solely on keywords without providing valuable content.</p>
                        <p><b>The Fix:</b> Create high-quality content that answers questions, provides solutions, or entertains. 
                            Google rewards content that engages users and meets their needs. Invest time in creating blog posts, 
                            articles, and other content that offers real value.</p>

                    <div class="details-digital">
                        <h3>5. Forgetting About Mobile Users</h3>
                        <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Having a website that isn’t mobile-friendly.</p>
                        <p><b>The Fix:</b> Ensure your website is responsive, meaning it looks and functions well on any device. 
                            With more people browsing on their phones, Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites in search rankings.</p>

                    <div class="details-digital">
                        <h3>6. Overlooking Page Speed</h3>
                        <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Not paying attention to how fast your website loads.</p>
                        <p><b>The Fix:</b> Use tools like Google Page Speed Insights to check your site’s speed. If it’s slow, 
                            consider optimizing images, enabling browser caching, and reducing server response times. A faster 
                            site not only ranks better but also keeps visitors happy.</p>

                        <h3>7. Ignoring Analytics</h3>
                        <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Not using tools like Google Analytics to track your SEO efforts.</p>
                        <p><b>The Fix:</b> Regularly review your analytics to see what’s working and what’s not. Look at metrics 
                            like bounce rate, average session duration, and page views to understand how visitors interact with your 
                            site. Use this data to make informed decisions about your SEO strategy.</p>

                    <div class="details-digital">
                        <h3>8. Missing Out on Local SEO</h3>
                        <p><b>The Mistake:</b> Neglecting local SEO if you run a local business.</p>
                        <p><b>The Fix:</b> Optimize your website for local searches by including local keywords, claiming your Google 
                            My Business listing, and getting reviews from local customers. This helps you show up in local search results 
                            and attract nearby customers.</p>
